						They needed a website that represented their rapidly scaling brand while highlighting what makes it a better alternative to energy than Red Bull.
						I had a chance to take creative lead and rewrite and redesign their old site and then finally build it out into something that is consistent with the current state of the brand. It has been a huge success.

	<div class="about-content">
		
			<p>You can call me a lot of things. A creative, a builder, a musician, a writer, a story-teller, etc, but you are most likely here because you needed something done on the web. That's where I am right now. The road that I took to get here has been fucking crazy. I wouldn't have it any other way. </p>

			<p>
			In one life I was a professional musician (i'm still pretty active), in another I earned more than <a href="http://pocketfives.com/profiles/chucksty" target="_blank">$2 million dollars</a> competing in professional poker tournaments. But despite being successful it didn't scratch my need to build, create, and do something positive. I decided I needed to put my creativity 
				and desire to good use and pursue something different. I joined <a href="http://www.knurture.com" target="_blank">Knurture</a>, a boutique UI/UX firm based in Durham, NC who design and build interfaces for some of the brightest startups in the world.
		 I soaked up all of the knowledge available. I learned first hand the value of design thinking and user-centric building practices. I had the opportunity to learn and study everything from business development and sales to wireframing, user research, and UI/UX design principles. I also managed a small team inhouse.	My time there was invaluable.</p>

			<p>Ultimately, I knew I wanted to build my own thing and knew I needed better technical skills in order to be successful. I began teaching myself to code. As luck would have it I found out that the <a href="http://www.theironyard.com">Iron Yard</a> needed a teacher's assistant for an upcoming front end class.
				It was a perfect fit. Later, I joined Groundwork Labs as their first ever developer-in-residence and had the opportunity to experience a startup accelerator through the eyes of both a founder and a developer.</p>

			<p> Now, I am help design, brand, market, develop, and ultimately grow digital products for companies and brands. <span><a href="mailto:tomrau@gmail.com">Get in touch.</a></span></p>
