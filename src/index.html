						They needed a website that represented their rapidly scaling brand while highlighting what makes it a better alternative to energy than Red Bull.
						I had a chance to take creative lead and rewrite and redesign their old site and then finally build it out into something that is consistent with the current state of the brand. It has been a huge success.

							startups in one of the most tech focused areas of the country. I was involved in the rebranding of the site in 2013 and have been involved in its maintenance
							and growth ever since. It is also happens to be the place where I producly do a majority of my work.

						<p class="work-p">Betti is online gambling for charity. Think about it like this... make a bet with a friend, a bet on anything. Each player chooses a non-profit and the loser's money
							is automatically sent via stripe to the organization of the winner's choosing. This puppy was built with python/flask and an angular front-end. I did all of beautiful angularjs, as well as the design.
							Betti was built in two and half hectic weeks. She is a work in progress.

	<div class="about-content">
		
			<p>You can call me a lot of things. A creative, a builder, a musician, a writer, a story-teller, etc, but you are most likely here because you needed something done on the web. That's where I am. And the road that I took to get here has been full of enough twists and
				turns to make your head spin. But I wouldn't have it any other way. </p>

			<p>
			In one life I was a professional musician, in another I earned more than $2 million dollars competing in professional poker tournaments. But despite my success there in 2010, I decided I wanted to put my creativity 
			and desire to build and pursue something different. I joined Knurture, a boutique UI/UX firm based in Durham, NC who design and build interfaces for some of the brightest startups in the world.
		 I learned first hand the value of design thinking and user-centric building practices. I had the opportunity to be involved in everything from business development and sales to design and project management.	My time there was invaluable.</p>

			<p>Ultimately, I knew I wanted to build my own thing and knew I needed better technical skills in order to be successful. I began teaching myself to code. At the end of 2014, I found out the Iron Yard needed a teacher's assistant for their upcoming front end class and I wanted to immerse myself in the world of javascript.
				It was a perfect fit. After that experience, I joined Groundwork Labs as their first ever developer-in-residence and had the opportunity to experience a startup accelerator through the eyes of both a founder and a developer.</p>

			<p> Now, I am helping design, brand, market, develop, and ultimately grow digital products for companies and brands. <span><a href="mailto:tomrau@gmail.com">Get in touch.</a></span></p>
