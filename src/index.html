  <li class="coming-soon">You can call me a lot of things. A creative, a builder, a musician, a writer, a story-teller, etc, but you are most likely here because I am a UI/UX designer/developer. The road that I took to get here has been full of enough twists and
		turns to make your head spin. But I wouldn't have it any other way. </li>
		
	<li>In one life I was a professional musician, in another I earned more than $2 million dollars competing in professional poker tournaments. But despite my success there in 2010, I decided I wanted to put my creativity 
	and desire to build and pursue something different. I joined Knurture, a boutique UI/UX firm based in Durham, NC who design and build interfaces for some of the brightest startups in the world.
 	I learned first hand the value of design thinking and user-centric building practices. I had the opportunity to be involved in everything from business development and sales to design and project management.	My time there was invaluable.</li>
		
	<li>Ultimately, I knew I wanted to build my own thing and knew I needed better technical skills in order to be successful. I began teaching myself to code. At the end of 2014, I found out the Iron Yard needed a teacher's assistant for their upcoming front end class and I wanted to immerse myself in the world of javascript.
		It was a perfect fit. After that experience, I joined Groundwork Labs as their first ever developer-in-residence and had the opportunity to experience a startup accelerator through the eyes of both a founder and a developer.</li>
		
	<li> Now, I a m helping design, brand, market, develop, and ultimately grow digital products for companies and brands. <span><a href="mailto:tomrau@gmail.com">Get in touch.</a></span></li>
